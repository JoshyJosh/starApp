This is map to both learn angularjs and stargazing.

The curent implementation only explores basic angular routing but it should also include a chronological representation of the visible sky above a certain location (possibly both coordinates and cities).

The star map is still being researched (hard to both get location and time).

TODO:
*current weather
*currently visible constelations list
*special events? (ISS, comets etc.)
